title: Epic Progress Field

Epic Progress Field adds a lightweight, automatic way to view progress across your Epics.  

It introduces a custom field that summarizes issue status counts within each Epic. For example, 2/3/0 for To Do / In Progress / Done.  
Add this field to your board card layout to see how an Epic is progressing without opening the issue or running reports. 

## Key features

- Automatically calculates and updates progress for each Epic
- Designed to be added to Jira board cards for instant visibility
- Works with your existing workflows and statuses
- Also useful for dashboards and filters
