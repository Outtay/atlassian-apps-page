Epic Progress Field adds a lightweight, automatic way to view progress across your Epics.  

It introduces a custom field that summarizes issue status counts within each Epic. For example, 2/3/0 for To Do / In Progress / Done.  
Add this field to your board card layout to see how an Epic is progressing without opening the issue or running reports. 

## Key features

- Automatically calculates and updates progress for each Epic
- Designed to be added to Jira board cards for instant visibility

- Also useful for dashboards and filters

## Security Policy

### Overview
Epic Progress Field runs entirely within Atlassian’s cloud infrastructure using the Forge platform. The app does not make any external network requests, and no customer data leaves Atlassian-controlled systems.

### Data Handling
The app processes only the Jira data required to calculate Epic progress. All data access occurs through official Forge APIs. The app stores no customer data outside of Atlassian’s environment and creates no external logs or replicas.

### Security Practices
All operations run inside Forge’s isolated, sandboxed runtime. Atlassian provides encryption in transit and at rest, and the app inherits these platform protections. Permissions are limited to only what is needed for functionality.

### External Services
The app uses no external APIs, services, or servers. It does not load remote resources, embed external scripts, or transmit data to third parties.

### Dependencies
Any included libraries are reviewed and updated regularly. The app bundles all dependencies directly and does not fetch code dynamically at runtime.

### Vulnerability Reporting
If you discover a security issue, please report it via email:  
[otti.f.software@gmail.com](mailto:otti.f.software@gmail.com).  
Reports will be acknowledged promptly, and fixes will be released as soon as possible.
